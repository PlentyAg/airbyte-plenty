# Airbyte

Plenty currently uses [StitchData](https://www.stitchdata.com/) to replicate replicate disparate sources of data to a central location. This closed-source solution makes it difficult to create custom solutions for edge cases. The modern open-source solution and alternative is [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) which boast impressive community support, financial momentum and developer support.

This repository is a fork of the [core-codebase](./README-original.md) which means that Plenty can develop custom connectors using a well designed API and always update the core technology via a PR. This also gives Plenty the chance to contribute back to the open-source community.
